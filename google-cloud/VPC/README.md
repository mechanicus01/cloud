## What are VPCs?

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private cloud hosted within a public cloud. It provides a secure and isolated environment for running applications and storing data. VPCs allow organizations to have more control over their cloud resources, including the ability to define their own network topology, IP address ranges, and security settings.
